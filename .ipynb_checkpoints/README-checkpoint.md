## Notebooks 

9 notebooks were made for this study. The objective is to clearly separate each approach and allowing the reader to have all the information for one specific dataset with one specific encoding approach. One notebook called `Baselines_ML` was done to generate the machine learning models baseline. 

List:
- `Baselines_ML.ipynb`: contains the results of the application of Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (CART), k-Neireast Neighbours (KNN), Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes (NB), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) on the `UCI_Credit_card.csv` and `fraud_detection_bank_dataset.csv` datasets.
